    <p class="description">
        This section explains how the school arranges information on its website, just like how 
        documents, records, and notices are arranged on a physical school notice board. The 
        structure helps the school present information clearly to parents, students, and teachers.
    </p>

    <div class="sass-card">
        <strong>School Information Sections:</strong>
        <p>
            The website contains different sections such as student records, announcements, class 
            summaries, and administrative notices. Each of these sections is organized for easy reading.
        </p>

        <strong>School Record Arrangement:</strong>
        <p>
            Just like files are arranged in the school office, the website groups related information 
            together—for example, student lists, attendance summaries, and academic performance updates.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sass-card">
        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
        <p>
            This organization helps the school keep information neat and accessible, ensuring both 
            students and parents can quickly find important school updates.
